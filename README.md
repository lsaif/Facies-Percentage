# FaciesPercentage
Calculate facies percentage within specific intervals

My friends and I made these codes to allow you to determine lithology based on log conditions and calculate its lithology percentage for each interval. It is free for you to input LAS file or directly use a preconditioned data which already has a lithology log. Well top or marker data from well is required in defining interval. A function to enable multi-well analysis and improve the flexibility is still under development.

This project is designed to support geological workflows specifically in dividing facies per interval which is further used for multiple objectives such as petrophysical analysis, basin modeling, GDE mapping, and Facies Bubble Map as shown in the workflow chart of this program.

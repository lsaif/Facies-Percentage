# FaciesPercentage
Calculate facies percentage within specific intervals

My friends and I made these codes to allow you to determine lithology based on log conditions and calculate its lithology percentage for each interval. It is free for you to input LAS file or directly use a preconditioned data which already has a lithology log. A function to enable multi-well analysis and improve the flexibility is still under development.
